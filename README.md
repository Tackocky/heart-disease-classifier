# Heart Disease Classifier
Building a classification model to try to predict if patients have heart disease or not.

In this project, I'm going to go through the full process of building out a classification model to predict if patients have heart disease or not. Some of the pieces involved in this project are exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model training, model evaluation, model comparisons, fine-tuning, and feature importance. Thanks for reading!
